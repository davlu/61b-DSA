covariance matrix: a tilda T * a tilda
where a_tilda is the mean centered matrix
A_tilda is n x m so there are m eigenvalues
(tall matrix)

properties: real/symmetric 
then the eigenvalues of eigendecomposition
are greater than = 0.

S = p V p^-1 where V is the eigenvalue matrix.

the columns for P is the princip. comp. values
and p1, p2, ... p_m each give you the 
maximum spread orthogonal to each successor.
(i.e p1 is the longest line in the spread of points.
p2 would be the orthogonal line to p1 other direction of spread)
identifies dimension of maximum spread.
